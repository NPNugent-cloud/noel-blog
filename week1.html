      <h2>Week 1 — Rebuilding From the Ground Up</h2>
      <p><strong>I finally admitted something to myself this week: you can’t build a tech career on shaky foundations.</strong></p>

      <p>If you spend any time online looking into “tech careers,” you know how chaotic it can be. Every YouTube video claims to reveal <em>the fastest path into tech</em> — cybersecurity, data analysis, software engineering, cloud, AI, helpdesk, DevOps… the list goes on. For a long time, I got caught in that noise. Jumping between tutorials, playlists, and roadmaps, never truly committing to one direction. It felt like trying to build a career on top of quicksand — no structure, no clarity, and definitely no foundation.</p>

      <p>This year, something finally clicked: <strong>If I wanted a real career, I needed a real path — and cloud engineering is where I belong.</strong></p>

      <h3>Why I Started With Linux</h3>
      <p>Every cloud engineer, DevOps engineer, or cybersecurity professional begins with the same core skill: Linux. It’s the OS behind servers, cloud instances, containers, and automation pipelines. But here’s what I realised:</p>
      <blockquote>Linux isn’t hard. What’s hard is learning it properly.</blockquote>

      <p>So instead of rushing through commands, I slowed down. I worked through real scenarios. I broke things on purpose — then fixed them. I documented everything in a clean, structured GitHub repo. This wasn’t just technical practice — it was discipline.</p>

      <h3>What I Accomplished in Week 1</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Linux fundamentals: file navigation, users, groups, permissions</li>
        <li>GitHub workflow: repo setup, clear documentation, proper commits</li>
        <li>Mindset training: daily routine, reading error messages, consistency</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Cutting Through the Noise</h3>
      <p>This week taught me that you don’t get closer to a career by watching more videos. You get closer by doing the work — slowly, correctly, and consistently.</p>
      <blockquote>Progress is never dramatic in the beginning. It’s built one command, one mistake, and one commit at a time.</blockquote>

      <h3>Looking Ahead to Week 2</h3>
      <p>Now that the foundations are in place, I’m moving on to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Advanced Linux permissions and archiving</li>
        <li>Basic networking commands (ping, traceroute, dig, ip)</li>
        <li>Strengthening GitHub workflow</li>
        <li>Continuing to build the habits of a junior cloud engineer</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Forward is forward. On to Week 2.</p>
